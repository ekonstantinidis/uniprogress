Thus d + 3 denotes the date 3 days after d, d - 1 denotes the date 1 day before d, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.To incorporate such a concept into our (given) models for this service as a whole, you will also need to consider at least some aspects of the daily \'operating cycle\' for a video rental service (e.g. adding the notion of today\'s date, and some way of moving on to the next day).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.Finally, impose a constraint on pending \'reservations\' { such that they never last for more than (say) 3 days: in other words, they all \'expire\' if not \'cancelled\' or transformed into a \'rental\' within that period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The required extensions should be developed in the following forms:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. an informal statement, in terms suitable for discussions with a client; 2. a formal statement, developed by extending the diagrammatic model.\r\nYou are not expected to modify the original classes – although you are free to do so if you see fit. However it will be necessary to extend (refine) the highest- level invariant (for class VR), and to extend some of its existing operations (or to provide a few new ones) in order to “satisfy” these additional requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exercise is to be approached in a spirit of “requirements engineering”. As such, you should seek to be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>clear</li>\r\n<li>simple</li>\r\n<li>precise</li>\r\n<li>general</li>\r\n<li>abstract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There will inevitably be some tension amongst these competing objectives – giving a useful insight into what this process often involves in practice.\r\nThe model should be carried through to a reasonable conclusion. In particular, you should illustrate how it is possible to reason whether various informally-stated requirements are satisfied.<p>',5);

The reflective commentary allows you an opportunity to explain what should have happened, as well as to consider the problems you have faced in completing that assignment.<p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Guidelines for the case study</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You will produce a case study, which will be a work of fact or fiction (or a combination of the two) of around 1,500-2000 words describing a situation where the five functional areas of network management (FCAPS) are not adhered to.\r\nThe work may take any literary form you wish, from verse to a radio play to a straightforward report to a short story to a technical article.\r\nThe story should be coherent, not just a set of different unrelated scenarios. This is because there are always dependencies between the different functional areas.\r\nAbove all, remember that we are looking for is evidence of your understanding of the practical application of FCAPS management. You will show us this by telling us what happens if a network is not managed this way.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scenario:<br />\r\nshould communicate technical issues clearly and concisely in a manner suitable for an inexperienced (though not novice) manager.<br />\r\nshould refer to all five functional areas of network management and the effects of not managing them.<br />\r\nshould display understanding of the technical causes and effects of the problem (e.g. it is not enough to say that the computer broke down- we need to know why, and how it relates to the issues of a lack of network management).<br />\r\nshould display understanding of the application of the functional areas of network management (e.g. it is not enough to observe faults, it is important to demonstrate the effects of NOT managing those faults)<br />\r\nshould demonstrate understanding of the interdependencies between different functional areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will not be marking you for literary prowess, though clarity and good reporting practice for whatever literary form you choose will count.
